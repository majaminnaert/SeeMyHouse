# SeeMyHouse
An application that shows a 3D model of the building/house at a given location based on coordinates.

## About

### What
A backend and interface for rendering a 3D model of a house at given 
coordinates in the area of Bruges, Belgium.

Extras, pending further inspiration, will be listed here.

### Why
Imagine a world where everyone can see their house, not by just walking outside and
looking at it, but by looking up the coordinates and typing them into some webpage or app
that then shows them a 3D model of their house based on LIDAR data. Wouldn't that be
awesome?

Also I want to show you what I can do with a keyboard, an internet connection and a decent
computer.

### When
Started: November 6, 2020

Deadline: November 20, 2020

### How
The evolution and general approach will
be described here as time passes. A first glance of
this, including issues encountered and
solutions/approaches found and tested, 
is available in the November 10 section of the
[workflow](workflow.md) file, and will be 
integrated in this README.md section early next working day.

Also see the daily [workflow](workflow.md) report. 

#### Approach and vague planning
The current phase is one of exploration: of the data, the files, needed libraries. It
is also a time of new beginnings: of the github repository, the notebook and other files in it, 
this readme file and an integrated PyCharm-centered workflow.

The future brings: extended data reconnaissance and iteratively building up the
required plots. ETA for finishing improvable basic prototype visualizations: tuesday-ish.

### Who
Maja Minnaert for BeCode

## Project To-Do List
There's also a [daily](daily.md) checklist.

### Pending and/or partially done
- [x] Explore&Design: experiment with this data & its visualisation
- [ ] Try visualizing limited & selected area around coordinate point

### To do later
- [ ] Find out how to 3D plot subset once selected area plot is achieved
- [ ] Design: make prototype interface
- [ ] Design: check for interface requirements?
- [ ] Design: loop above four until result satisfactory
- [ ] Set up project Github Page for information/presentation

### Done
- [x] Set up environment in pycharm
- [X] Install needed base packages
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Link pycharm project to github repository
- [x] Pimp up the readme file
- [x] Set up md file "workflow.md" for daily reporting
- [x] Check what geopandas is
- [x] Install geopandas
- [x] Determine use case data subset
- [x] Download the data
- [x] Add notebook for example files & gpd learning
- [x] Add [notes](notes.txt) file for virtual post-its
- [x] Explore Data: study file types
- [x] Learn to work with geopandas
- [x] Explore Data: look at data contents
- [x] Explore Data: determine, try-out and find/choose needed packages
