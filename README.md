# SeeMyHouse
An application that shows a 3D model of the building/house at a given location based on coordinates.

## About


### What
A backend and interface for rendering a 3D model of a house at given coordinates.

Extras, pending further inspiration, will be listed here.

### Why
Imagine a world where everyone can see their house, not by just walking outside and
looking at it, but by looking up the coordinates and typing them into some webpage or app
that then shows them a 3D model of their house based on LIDAR data. Wouldn't that be
awesome?

Also I want to show you what I can do with a keyboard, an internet connection and a decent
computer.

### When
Started: November 6, 2020

Deadline: November 20, 2020

### How
The evolution and general approach will
be described here as time passes.

Also see the daily [workflow](workflow.md) report. 

#### Approach and vague planning
The current phase is one of exploration: of the data, the files, needed libraries. It
is also a time of new beginnings: of the github repository, the notebook and other files in it, 
this readme file and an integrated PyCharm-centered workflow.

The future brings: extended data reconnaissance and iteratively building up the
required plots. ETA for finishing improvable basic prototype visualizations: tuesday-ish.

### Who
Maja Minnaert for BeCode

## Project To-Do List
There's also a [daily](daily.md) checklist.

### Pending
- [ ] Learn to work with geopandas
- [ ] Explore Data: learn new data types
- [ ] Explore Data: look at data contents
- [ ] Explore Data: determine, try-out and find/choose needed packages
- [ ] Explore&Design: experiment with data & its visualisation

### To do later
- [ ] Design: preliminary solutions
- [ ] Design: experiment with/test solutions
- [ ] Design: make prototype
- [ ] Design: loop above four until result satisfactory
- [ ] Design: check for interface requirements?
- [ ] Set up project Github Page for information/presentation

### Done
- [x] Set up environment in pycharm
- [X] Install needed base packages
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Link pycharm project to github repository
- [x] Pimp up the readme file
- [x] Set up md file "workflow.md" for daily reporting
