Notes for reuse

1. Coordinates for experimentation
Bruges: 51.2093° N, 3.2247° E

2. Ideas to advance project
Try to plot a 40 square meter area around given coordinates (2D)
Try the same in 3D

3. Approach notes:
- window is the best way to slice the geotiff
- this can be done based on a center coordinate and using
how much to the left, right, top and center to set the bounds
of the slice
- parse the sliced tiff, which returns as a numpy nd-array, into
a pandas (basic pandas is fine) dataframe, which should contain
the x, y and z data that plotly can work with to draw the
interactive surface plot
- once this workflow is done and implemented in a .py-script,
it's onward to making a userfriendly UX
