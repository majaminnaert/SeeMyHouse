## Where to find
At the moment, the .py script file found
 on the Github repo (click "View on GitHub") is the 
only way to run this app. A readme with usage instruction
is pending, though the current CLI interface already
provides directions as well.

## About
### What
A python script for rendering a 3D model of a house at given 
coordinates based on a user-provided GeoTIFF.

There is currently only a CLI based version, plans are
in place to make a Dash web application with similar functionality
and a py-script that operates with a simple GUI. This is first
and foremost a practice experience embedded in BeCode's AI Bootcamp
training, however I would enjoy building further on it.

If you found this link through my future portfolio, you can see this
as my first full application project.

### Why
Imagine a world where everyone can see their house, not by just walking outside and
looking at it, but by looking up the coordinates and typing them into some webpage or app
that then shows them a 3D model of their house based on LIDAR data. Wouldn't that be
awesome?

Also I want to show you what I can do with a keyboard, an internet connection and a decent
computer.
