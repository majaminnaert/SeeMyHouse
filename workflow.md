# Daily workflow reports
## November 6, 2020
Set up git repository and project page,
filled in details on the readme file and 
studied the data files, their file types, the geopandas
library and started up a notebook for initial
data reconnaissance.
## November 9, 2020
Explored the data and imported a subset into my 
pycharm project folder. 
First code tryouts in jupyter notebook revealed what
other libraries are useful/needed. Ran into issue
when pygeos was installed, eventually removed this
and re√Ønstalled geopandas to resolve the issue it
caused in geopandas.

The Jupyter Notebook workflow is up and running now,
Still researching ways to plot in 3D and to read the
relevant data from the available files. I certainly
have a clearer view of what needs to be done in terms
of visualization code. The data types are still unclear,
but exploring them through jupyter notebook and the 
libraries and as such learning by doing looks promising.

Basically, I'm in the middle of exploring the multitude
of approaches findable out there, and starting to get
some overview and idea of what direction to go
to zoom in on the most efficient methods.
